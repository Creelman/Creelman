Hi, Iâ€™m OdhrÃ¡n, I'm currently studying MSci (Hons) Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and I am in my penultimate year.

Current research interests include AI/ML in the context of simulations, automatic software verification and model checking, and constraint modelling/solving.

I'm currently working on open-sourcing many of my past projects including a [CTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic) model checker, a lightweight reliable network protocol, a virtual FAT file system, a fractal render engine, and several Hackathon projects, once I gain permission from collaborators and clients.

If you would like private access to one of these projects in the meantime, please let me know.

If you're interested in collaborating (or have internship opportunities ðŸ‘€) feel free to reach out!

You can also connect with me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/odhran-creelman/)!
