Hi, I’m Odhrán, I'm currently studying MSci (Hons) Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and I am in my penultimate year.

Current research interests include AI/ML in the context of simulations, automatic software verification and model checking, and constraint modelling/solving.
